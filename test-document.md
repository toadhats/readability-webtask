This is a long paragraph containing multiple sentences, like the actual body text of the page that we actually want to look at. Other stuff might get caught as well, and I'm still working on ways to filter everything properly.

Here's another paragraph, the kind we are interested in. I hope it is counted. These sentences do not have many words in them. This should give us a relatively high readability score. There are quite a few polysyllabic words, however, which will reduce the score.
